# Cats-and-Dogs-classification

The following analysis aims at developing Convolutional Neural Neu-
troks for the classification of Cats and Dogs images. The projects is
structured as follows: I used Tensorflow to build 4 models, each having a
different architecture, to inspect the impact of varying parameters in the
networks. I, then, evaluated the performance of the model using k-fold
cross validation.
